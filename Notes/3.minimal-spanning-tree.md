# Minimum Spanning Tree
(of a graph)

A tree has no cycles, thus, a tree always has n nodes and (n-1) edges.

The goal of these two algorithms is to find a subtree of this graph whose total edge weight is the smallest. Both of these two algos are greedy.


## Prim's Algorithm (Greedy)
**How to remember**: First select the shortest edge, then always select the connected shortest edge


## Kruskal Algorithm (Greedy)
**How to remember**: Always select the shortest edge unless it forms a cycle
