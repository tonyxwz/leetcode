# Binary Tree

## DFS

- preorder:  |root|left...|right...|
- inorder:   |left...|root|right...|
- postorder: |left...|right...|root|

Given the order of inorder traveral and the order of either preorder or postorder traversal, the binary tree can be restored

- 889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal.cc
- 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal.cc
- 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal.cc

## BFS

Use a queue to store each level
