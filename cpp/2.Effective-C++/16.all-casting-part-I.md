# Casting part I

Casting: explicit type conversion

In C++, four casting provided as function templates
- `static_cast`
- `dynamic_cast`
- `const_cast`
- `reinterpret_cast`


## 1. static cast
object -> another object
work on any type as long as the conversion is defined.
also works on pointer of related types (superclass <-> subclasses)


## 2. dynamic cast
1. only work on pointers and references (typically from base class to derived class)
2. with run-time type-check, return target pointer if success otherwise nullptr
3. require the two types to be polymorphic (at least one virtual function)

## 3. const cast
only works on pointers and references
only works on same types (const -> non-const) verse vesa
cast away constness

## 4. reinterpret cast
works with any cast


## 5. c style casting

# Guide line
use c++ style is recommended
