view parameters as a way of expanding the search scope

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using std::cout;

// here << is found through ADL
std::cout << "Hi.\n";

// without ADL, we will need
// ideally
std::cout std::<< "Hi\n";
// actually
std::operator<<(std::cout, "Hi.\n");
```

Engineering principle:
1. Functions that operate on class C and in the same namespace as C are part of
   C's interface.
2. Functions that are a part of C's interface should be in the same namespace as
   C.

interface doesn't have to be class member functions
