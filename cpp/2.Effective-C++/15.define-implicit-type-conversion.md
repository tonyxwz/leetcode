constructor that takes only a single parameter is not just a constructor
it is a constructor and a implicit type convertor.

if this function is intented to be used as constructor only, it is good practice
    to put `explicit` keyword in front of the function declaration.

Guideline:
1. avoid defining seemingly unexpected convertions, e.g., from a string to a dog
2. avoid two-way convertion, if `A->B` is defined, the don't define `B->A`
