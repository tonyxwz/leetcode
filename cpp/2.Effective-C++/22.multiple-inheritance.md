 see code

Pure abstract class:
abstract class that has only pure virtual functions
no data, no concrete functions
(similar to interface in C sharp)


ISP: interface segregation principle
PAC: Pure abstract class

summary:
multiple inheritance is useful
derive only from PAC when dealing with multiple inheritance
