convention:

class for complex data type
struct used as data container

struct data member are name as they are
class private data members are name with a trailing underscore.
Why not leading underscore (like in python)?
    In C++, leading underscores have other purposes (global functions, internal
    implemntation related variables).

Too many setter and getter functions indicate that the design is problematic. If
you need to pass the private data to someone else very often, maybe you
shouldn't own the data.
