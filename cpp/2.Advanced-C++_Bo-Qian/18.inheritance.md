# Inheritance

- Public
- Protected
- Private

```cpp
class B {
    public:
        void f_pub();
    protected:
        void f_prot();
    private:
        void f_priv();
};
class D_pub: public B {
    public:
        void f() {
            f_pub(); // OK
            f_prot(); // OK
            f_priv(); // Error
        }
};
class D_priv: private B {
    public:
        void f() {
            f_pub(); // OK D_priv's private function f_pub
            f_prot(); // OK
            f_priv(); // error
        }
};
class D_prot: protected B {
    public:
        void f() {
            f_pub(); // d_prot's protected funciton
            f_prot(); // d_prot's protected function
            f_priv(); // error
        }
};

int main() {
    D_pub d1;
    d1.f_pub(); // OK

    // if it is need to use f_pub:
    bring f_pub to the scope of D_prot with `using` statement
    D_prot d2;
    d2.f_pub();  // error

    D_priv d3;
    d3.f_pub(); // error
}
```

Access control rules
1. no derived class can access anything that is private in base class
2. inherit public as public ans protected member as protected
3. inherit public and protected members as private
4. inherit public and protected members as protected

casting:
1. anyone can cast public inherit child to base class. in other words,
   `D_pub` is a special form of `B`.
2. only member and friend function of `D_priv` can cast `D_priv` into B
3. `D_prot`'s  member function, friend function and children can cast `D_prot`
   into `B`

Only public function means the `is-a` relation

Private inheritance means `has-a` relation. similar to composition rather than
inheritance. (composition is preferred)
