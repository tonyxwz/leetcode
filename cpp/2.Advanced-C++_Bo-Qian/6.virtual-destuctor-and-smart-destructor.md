classes for polymophic use should have a virtual destructor

If virtual destructor is not possible, then `shared_ptr` could be used as well.
Note that only `shared_ptr` could perform this magic. `unique_ptr` cannot.

All the STL classes don't have virtual destructor, careful when inheriting from
them.
