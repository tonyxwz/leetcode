# Resource managing classes

## rule of 3 / 4.5
If class owns data member allocated on the heap, you should define 
- destructor
- copy constructor
- copy assignment operator
- move constructor (C++ 11)
- move assignment operator (C++ 11)

## Deleting copy constructor and copy assignment operator
Making the above mentioned function private. Then define a public clone function
that returns a deep copy of the object.

benefit is this make copying very explicit and verbose.

implicit copying is usually the pointer where bugs are introduced
