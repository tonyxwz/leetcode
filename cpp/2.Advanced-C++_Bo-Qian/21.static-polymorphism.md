simulated polymorphism
static polymorphism
curiously recurring template pattern

define base class as a template
```cpp
template<typename T>
class Generic
{
public:
    void generic_algo(int a){
        // here this is cast into a `T*` type, which can invoke generic algo
        // defined inside `Derived`
        static_cast<T*>(this)->generic_algo(a);
    }
};

class Derived : public Generic<Derived>
{
public:
    void generic_algo(int a) {
         // do some thing concrete
    }
};
```

Very popular in library code, because it is more efficient

tradeoff: `Generic<Derived1>` and `Generic<Derived2>` are different and have
their own space in the binary image. As a result, the size of the program image
is larger.

TMP: template meta-programming
