Given the assumptions that `p` and `q` are present in the tree and `p` and `q` are unique


```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // given the condition that q and p are always present and unique
        // there's no need to consider the situation when p is ancestor of q
        // because if this is the case, then return p is still valid.
        if (!root || root == p || root == q) return root;
        TreeNode* l = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* r = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        if (l && r) return root;
        return l ? l : r;
    }
